# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Homo sapien interested in AI & ML. I also have a strong interest in Physics and cars. I created **Perplexica**, an open-source alternative to Perplexity AI, and I am working on several other projects as well.

If someone says to me that AI will take over the world, I have one thing to say:
**"Calculators never replace mathematicians, neither will AI."**

Neural networks just try hard.

## ðŸš€ Projects
- **Perplexica**: An open-source alternative to Perplexity AI.

More projects are in progress.
